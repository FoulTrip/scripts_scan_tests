async def displayDevicesAsync(devices, audio_devices, check_availability):
    """
    Asynchronously displays a list of Bluetooth devices along with their status.

    Args:
        devices (list): A list of Bluetooth devices to display.
        audio_devices (set): A set of addresses of Bluetooth devices that are recognized as audio devices.
        check_availability (function): An asynchronous function that checks if a device is available.

    Functionality:
        1. Prints a header "Devices found:".
        2. Iterates over the list of devices.
        3. For each device, determines if its address is in the `audio_devices` set to check if it is an audio device.
        4. Asynchronously calls `check_availability` to determine if the device is available.
        5. Prints the device details, including its address, name, whether it is an audio device, and its availability status.

    Notes:
        - The function uses the `await` keyword to handle the asynchronous `check_availability` function properly.
